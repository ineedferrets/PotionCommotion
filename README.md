# PotionCommotion
The OFFICIAL GutHub repository for the world-renowned, triple-A title Potion Commotion.

Potion Commotion is a local 4 player bomberman style game with crafting and base defence.
Players play as a witch aiming to be the last witch standing.
The witches are magically linked to their cauldron and can respawn if their cauldron has not been destroyed.
To destroy each other's cauldrons, players need to craft potions.
The ingredients for the potions spawn randomly across the map.
To craft, players need to be at their cauldron!
